# pomoduroPomoduro is a simple web application to manage [pomodoros][POM01] along theworkday automatically. You only must program the time to start and the length of work and breakintervals for each pomodoro. Optionally, you can define a warning intervalbetween work and break in order to advise you.## More info- [Pomoduro at Github][GIT01]- [License][LIC01]- [Authors][AUT01] [AUT01]: https://github.com/rafacouto/pomoduro/blob/master/AUTHORS.md[GIT01]: https://github.com/rafacouto/pomoduro[LIC01]: https://github.com/rafacouto/pomoduro/blob/master/LICENSE[POM01]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
